  Search Algorithms - There is an old city that has an antique plumbing system. There are a lot of pipes in the city   that are useless or rarely work. We want to find a route for water to traverse from one side of the city to the      other side. One strange fact about this city is that some of the pipes which are old do not function in specific     times. So, the route for water might be different in different times. Time periods when each pipe doesn’t work will   be given. The task is to find a route based on the availability of the pipes in a given time using search            algorithms. Start time that water will start flowing is given and then we have to report the time at which water     reaches the other side of the city. Uninformed search algorithms i.e. DFS – BFS – UCS are implemented.
