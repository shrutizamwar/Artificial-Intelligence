waterFlow.py - There is an old city that has an antique plumbing system. There are a lot of pipes in the city that
are useless or rarely work. We want to find a route for water to traverse from one side of the city to the other side. One strange fact about this city is that some of the pipes which are old do not function in specific times. So, the route for water might be different in different times. You will be given the time periods when each pipe doesn’t work. Your task is to find a route based on the availability of the pipes in a given time using search algorithms. You are given the start time that water will start flowing and then you have to report the time which water reaches the other side of the city. You will be using uninformed search algorithms that you have learned in class, i.e. you will be implementing DFS – BFS – UCS for this assignment.
